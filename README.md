# targets: a rediscovery from a different field

The practice of Statistics creates non-statistical challenges whose solutions come from software engineering. Version control, portable package libraries, and literate programming are already well-known examples. Pipeline tools, however, are an unlooked-for answer to workflow management struggles people seldom realize they have. The {targets} package is a pipeline tool that scales to large workloads, saves time, and embraces the comfort of your local R environment. This talk showcases {targets} tackling a formidable real-world example from Bayesian data analysis, and it posits a trove of unconventional breakthroughs waiting to be noticed by statisticians.
